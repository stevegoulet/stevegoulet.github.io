I am a healthcare technology executive with over 20 years of experience leading digital health transformations: 
- Proven expertise in artificial intelligence including leadership, governance, architecture, engineering and execution of both generative AI and ML applications.
- Custom application implementation across diverse healthcare settings.
- Adept at managing technology and product teams, aligning IT and clinical operations, and delivering measurable gains in reliability, performance, and outcomes.
- The stewardship of AI safety, privacy and governance is my passion and the focus of /intheloop - an open source project that will demonstrate that privacy-first AI oversight is implementable, not just theoretical.  

In my role at [Mentavi](https://mentavi.com) I lead the design, engineering and delivery of digital behavioral healthcare products and systems.
